								<p>Ok, where do I begin? Well, let's start with why I pursued a career in this field in the first place.
									For me, the biggest appeal behind software engineering is the collaborative nature of it.
									Just being able to build something from the ground up or help finishing something with anyone from around the world is a great experience.
									I love being able to contribute and peek at open source software to draw inspiration for my own personal projects.
								</p>
								<p>I have never been one to shy away from a challenge. In the face of adversity, I welcome whatever comes at me. 
									To go more into detail, and on a more personal note, I am a cancer survivor. I was diagnosed during my sophomore year of college mid-spring semester.
									During finals week, I was undergoing chemotherapy but even at the lowest point of my health and arguably my life, I managed to pull through and beat the semester as well as the cancer.
									It was a rough point but as morbid as it sounds, I'm glad I went through what I did. For better or worse it made me who I am and it's shown me that I am a persistent and resilient person.
								 </p>
								 <p>So what is there to me outside of my career aspirations? Well, in my free time I build high performance PCs and generally love to tinker with other hardware.
									The computer science concept of abstraction is something I throw out the window when I find myself tinkering with things during my leisure time. I am a very curious individual and sometimes
									I need to know what is going on behind the scenes of things most people take for granted.
								 </p>
								 <p>Well, that's all about me and if you'd like to know more, then feel free to reach out on one of my socials!</p>
